HibernateUtilities is where our hibernate sessionfactory is constructed. 
The sessionfactory is the first step of java hibernate, because it contains configuration that join
the java application (via hibernate) to the database.

----------------------------------------- What is a sessionfctoty? ---------------------------------------------

 Sessionfactory is a feature that allows us to create session. It's a feature that needs to be executed once 
 the applications start-up, and from then we starts to make sessions, which are parts of the code that go back and forth from the java
 appliation to the database. It's thread safe and immutable(they can't change)

 A good way to look at sessionfactory, is to consider it a car manufacturing plant (factory), which builds 
 cars(sessions); once a car factory is built, it start producing car, but without the factory, we would not 
 be able to make cars(session). 
 
 ------- How are sessionfactories made? --------
   They are made by getting data from the hibernate.cfg.xml which you have configure. The hibernate.cfg.xml
   contains data regarding the database location, database type, username, and etc
   
   
   ---------------------- | What is a session? |--------------------------------
   
   Is a thread that helps manage stuff by forming a connection that helps storing and retrieving data. 
   The session is the infastructure(connection) that lets you do hibernetty stuff.
